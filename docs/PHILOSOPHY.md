# The Philosophy Behind the Founder Skill Pack

## Why This Exists

Coding agents are extraordinary at generating code. They're mediocre at answering the questions that actually determine whether a product succeeds:

- What should I build first?
- Who is this really for?
- How should this feel to use?
- What do my users actually think?
- Have I built something people genuinely want?

These are product questions, not code questions. This skill pack exists to answer them — with the same expertise and confidence that a great co-founder or advisor would.

## The Shape of the Journey

Most tools assume product-building is linear. You plan, you design, you build, you launch. Done.

It isn't. Great products are built **spirally**. You ship something, you observe what happens, you listen to real people, you figure out what actually matters, you improve it — and the next cycle is better than the last because you compounded the learnings.

The first four phases happen roughly once (though they're revisited). The Compounding Stage and PMF phase are loops — designed to be returned to every cycle.

## MVP vs MPP: The Most Important Distinction Nobody Talks About

**MVP — Minimum Viable Product**

The minimum needed to *test* whether the idea has merit. Low bar. Ships fast. Validates the hypothesis. Most advice focuses here.

The problem: "viable" is a very low bar. Viable means it works. It doesn't mean anyone loves it, recommends it, or would miss it if it disappeared.

**MPP — Minimum Proud Product**

The minimum version you'd put your name on and confidently show to someone you deeply respect. Users would genuinely recommend it without being asked. It creates emotion — pride in you, delight in them.

A founder knows they've hit MPP when:
- They'd be *embarrassed not* to show it to someone they admire
- At least one user has described it to someone else without being prompted
- The product creates a feeling, not just a function
- There's evidence someone cared deeply — in the details, the copy, the edge cases

**The gap between MVP and MPP is where most products die.**

They ship viable. They never become proud. They add features based on whoever complained loudest, without a structured reflection process. They plateau.

The Compounding Stage skills exist specifically to close that gap — systematically, not by accident.

## The Compounding Loop

Compounding doesn't happen automatically. It requires a discipline most founders skip:

```
Ship
  → Reflect honestly (what worked? what didn't? what surprised us?)
  → Gather real feedback (from users, not friends)
  → Synthesize signal from noise (what does it actually mean?)
  → Prioritize ruthlessly (ONE thing, not a list)
  → Ship better
  → Repeat

Each cycle: faster, sharper, more confident.
```

The key word is *honestly*. Most founders reflect in ways that confirm what they already believe. The `cycle-reflector` skill is designed to interrupt that — to surface the things you're avoiding looking at.

## The True Partner

Most skills are reactive. You invoke them when you know what you need. A true partner is different.

A true partner:
- Knows where you are in the journey
- Tells you what to focus on *before* you ask
- Holds memory across sessions — your product, your users, your metrics
- Asks the uncomfortable question you're avoiding
- Detects PMF signals you might miss

The `founder-partner` skill implements this. It reads a `founder-context.md` file you maintain in your project — a living record of your product's story — and uses it to give you the kind of guidance that usually only comes from a co-founder who's been in every room.

---

## PMF: Not a Moment, but a Pattern

Product-Market Fit is often described like a switch — you either have it or you don't. That's not quite right.

PMF is a pattern that becomes visible when you're looking for it:

- **Retention:** Users come back without you prompting them
- **Organic growth:** Users tell others without incentive
- **Grief:** Your best users would be genuinely upset if the product disappeared
- **Depth:** Users find features you didn't explain and use them heavily
- **Revenue retention:** Expansion revenue exceeds churn

Most non-technical founders don't know to look for these signals — or confuse vanity metrics (signups, traffic) with PMF signals. The Phase 6 skills teach you to see the difference.

## The Core Principle

> Build what's needed. Ship it. Learn honestly. Improve with intention. Repeat until proud. Then grow.

Everything in this skill pack serves that principle.
