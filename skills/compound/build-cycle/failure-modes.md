# Failure Modes — What To Do When Cycles Show Stagnation

When 3+ consecutive cycles show flat or declining signal, this document guides the diagnosis.

This is not a crisis document. Stagnation is normal — most products go through it. The difference between founders who get through it and those who don't is diagnosis quality.

## The Stagnation Signal

The build-cycle skill triggers this document when ALL of the following are true for 3+ consecutive cycles:
- MPP score: flat or declining
- PMF signal: not improving
- The founder's commitment from the previous cycle was actually executed (not skipped)

If the commitment wasn't executed, the cause is execution, not product. That's a different problem.

## The Five Failure Modes

Every product stagnation fits one of five patterns. The diagnosis determines the prescription.

---

### Failure Mode 1: Wrong Customer

**What it looks like:**
- Users engage in early conversations but don't return
- Feedback is generally positive but non-specific ("it's nice")
- No one can articulate what they'd lose if the product disappeared
- The founder is reaching out to get users rather than users finding the product

**The diagnostic question:**
"Describe the last 5 users who actually engaged meaningfully. What do they have in common that your other users don't?"

**The test:**
Find 5 people who EXACTLY match the description of your most engaged user. Show them the product cold. If engagement immediately jumps, the customer was too broad. If they're equally unengaged, it's not a customer problem.

**The prescription:**
Dramatically narrow the customer. Not "small business owners" — "solo bookkeepers in their first 2 years of practice." Go so narrow it feels uncomfortable. You can always broaden later. You can't build a great product for everyone.

---

### Failure Mode 2: Wrong Problem

**What it looks like:**
- Users understand the product immediately but don't use it regularly
- Feedback is about features, not about the core problem being solved
- Users have active workarounds that they prefer to the product
- Usage happens when prompted, not organically

**The diagnostic question:**
"If your product disappeared tomorrow, what would your most engaged user do instead — and how long would it actually take them to find a solution?"

**The test:**
Ask 5 users: "Walk me through the last time you had the problem this product solves." If they struggle to name a recent specific instance, the problem isn't frequent enough or painful enough.

**The prescription:**
Run fresh customer discovery — but this time look for users who have solved the problem in ways that are obviously painful. Their workaround is the signal. If they're using spreadsheets and they hate it, the problem is real. If they have no workaround, the problem isn't urgent.

---

### Failure Mode 3: Wrong Solution

**What it looks like:**
- Users HAVE the problem and it IS painful, but they don't adopt the product
- Specific friction points in the product get named repeatedly
- Users start the onboarding and don't complete it
- Users complete onboarding but never reach the core value moment

**The diagnostic question:**
"Where exactly does the product lose users? What's the last step before they stop?"

**The test:**
Watch 5 users try to complete the core flow — without helping them. Note exactly where they slow down, hesitate, or give up. This is your friction map.

**The prescription:**
Run the "concierge" version of your product — manually do what the product is supposed to do automatically, but better. If the manual version works and users love it, the problem is in the product implementation. If even the manual version doesn't work, it's a deeper problem.

---

### Failure Mode 4: Wrong Timing (Market Not Ready)

**What it looks like:**
- Users intellectually understand the value but don't urgently need it now
- Adoption requires behavior change that users are reluctant to make
- The workaround is tolerable enough that urgency is low
- Users who love the product are the innovators (< 2.5% of market) — not the early majority

**The diagnostic question:**
"Is there a specific event or trigger that makes this problem suddenly urgent for someone — and are you reaching people at that moment?"

**The test:**
Find the moment right before a potential user feels the pain most acutely. Are you there? Can you be?

**The prescription:**
Timing-based GTM. Don't market to everyone with the problem — market to people who just encountered the trigger. New restaurant manager at a restaurant that already tracks waste: right moment. Restaurant manager who's been doing it the same way for 5 years: wrong moment.

---

### Failure Mode 5: Wrong Distribution

**What it looks like:**
- Users who discover the product through certain channels are much better than others
- The channels you're using reach the wrong person (e.g., LinkedIn ads reaching HR, but the buyer is the CFO)
- CAC is rising, not falling
- Referral rate is near zero

**The diagnostic question:**
"Where did your best users come from — the ones who actually stayed and found value? How did they hear about you?"

**The test:**
Interview your 3 best users about how they found you. Trace the exact path. Then check: can you systematically create more of that path?

**The prescription:**
Kill the channels that aren't producing your best users. Double down on the one that is, even if it doesn't scale yet. A small, systematic channel that reaches the right person beats a large channel that reaches the wrong one.

## The Pivot Conversation

If the failure mode diagnosis runs and the prescription is tried for 2 more cycles with no improvement, it's time to have the pivot conversation.

The pivot conversation is not a failure moment — it's an information moment. It means:

> "We now have strong evidence that [specific assumption] is wrong. That changes what we should build."

**The three pivot types:**
1. **Customer pivot** — keep the solution, find who it's actually for
2. **Problem pivot** — keep the customer, find what they actually need most
3. **Solution pivot** — keep the customer and problem, find a better approach

**The pivot is not:**
- Starting over completely
- Abandoning everything you've learned
- A sign of failure

**The pivot IS:**
- The most important use of the evidence you've gathered
- Evidence of intellectual honesty
- Usually the turning point that precedes PMF

## What the Agent Says at Stagnation Detection

> "I need to name something before we decide what to do next. We've had [N] cycles where the signal hasn't improved — MPP score has been [X, Y, Z] and PMF signal has stayed [same level]. That's not a reason to panic, but it means doing another cycle the same way probably won't give us different results.
>
> Before we commit to next cycle's action, I want to run a failure mode diagnosis. This takes 10 minutes. The goal isn't to make you feel bad — it's to find the specific thing that's stuck so we can unstick it.
>
> Are you ready to look at this honestly?"
