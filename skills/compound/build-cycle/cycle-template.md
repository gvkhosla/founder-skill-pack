# Cycle [N] — [YYYY-MM-DD]

## What We Shipped
[1–3 sentences. What actually went out the door since last cycle.]

## What Users Actually Did
[What users did — behavior, not what they said. Be specific. Numbers where possible.]

### The Signal
[The most meaningful thing a user did or didn't do. One thing. The one that matters most.]

### What We Avoided Looking At
[The honest answer. Something that happened that you'd prefer to explain away.]

## The Honest Assessment

**MPP Score:** [X]/10
**Why:** [One sentence — the specific thing holding it back]

**PMF Signal:** [None / Faint / Building / Clear]
**Why:** [One sentence — the specific evidence for this rating]

## Patterns (from last 3 cycles)
[Only filled in when 3+ cycles exist. What pattern is emerging?]
- Momentum: [trending up / flat / declining]
- Effort pattern: [something you keep doing that isn't producing signal]
- Avoidance pattern: [something you've mentioned but not done]

## The One Decision
**Commitment:** [Exact wording from Phase 5 — the one thing to do next cycle]
**Success signal:** [Specific observable thing that would tell you it worked]
**Why this, not something else:** [One sentence rationale]

## What I Learned This Cycle
[The single most important learning. Not a list — one thing. Write it as a sentence you'd tell a founder friend.]

## What I'm Carrying Forward
[One question or uncertainty that this cycle opened but didn't answer — to revisit next cycle]

## Notes for the agent writing this document

- **Never soften the assessment.** If MPP score is 3, write 3.
- **One thing per field.** "What users did" is the most meaningful behavior, not a list.
- **"What I learned" must be a complete sentence** — not a bullet, not a fragment. Something the founder could say out loud.
- **"What I'm carrying forward" is the thread** that connects this cycle to the next. It's the thing left unresolved that the next cycle should answer.
- **Preserve exact wording of the commitment.** The founder should be able to read it next cycle and immediately know what they committed to.
