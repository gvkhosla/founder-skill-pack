# MPP Criteria — Quick Reference

Used by build-cycle (Phase 3) for the in-cycle MPP score and by mpp-evaluator for deep assessment.

## Scoring Quick Guide

| Criterion | Question to Ask | 1–3 | 4–6 | 7–9 | 10 |
|-----------|----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **Pride** | Would you show it without apologizing? | Actively avoid showing | Show with caveats | Show without apology | Excited to share unprompted |
| **Recommendation** | Has anyone shared it without being asked? | No evidence | 1–2 instances | Regular pattern | Measurable word-of-mouth |
| **Emotion** | What do users feel after the core task? | Nothing | Mild satisfaction | Clear positive feeling | Delight or transformation |
| **Craft** | Evidence someone cared about details? | Rough, placeholder | Mostly functional | Details considered | Every touchpoint intentional |
| **Grief** | How would the best user react if it disappeared? | Would shrug | Mild inconvenience | Genuinely frustrated | Devastated |

## The MPP Threshold

**Score ≥ 7.0** = MPP achieved. This is the bar to clear before focusing on scale.

Below 7.0: focus on the lowest-scoring criterion first. Don't spread improvement across all five — pick the one gap and close it.

## What Usually Holds Products Below MPP

In order of frequency:

1. **Emotion Test (most common gap)** — The product completes jobs but doesn't create feeling. Usually fixed by: better copy, meaningful confirmation moments, thoughtful empty states, first-run experience.

2. **Recommendation Test** — Users don't share because sharing requires confidence that the product will work for the person they're sharing with. Usually fixed by: removing friction from first use, not the product's core features.

3. **Grief Test** — Users haven't integrated it into their workflow yet. Usually fixed by: reducing time-to-value (faster to first "aha"), or increasing usage frequency.

4. **Craft Test** — Usually fixed by: one focused pass on error messages, loading states, and empty states. These three alone often move the score significantly.

5. **Pride Test (rarest gap)** — If founders still apologize for the product, it's often because they're comparing it to the imagined final version, not to the realistic alternative (the workaround). Reframe: "better than the spreadsheet" is MPP for many B2B tools.
