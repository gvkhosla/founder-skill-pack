# Landing Page Copywriter

## Quick Start

Say: **"Write my landing page copy"** or **"Help me write my homepage"**

Share your positioning doc or describe your product. Total time: 20 minutes.
Output: `landing-page-copy.md` — every section of your landing page written, section by section, ready to implement.

## What You'll Get

A `landing-page-copy.md` with every section written: hero (headline + subheadline + CTA), problem section, solution section (3 key benefits), social proof section, how it works, objection-handling, pricing teaser, and final CTA. Each section includes copy + a note on what visual to use alongside it.

> **Example output excerpt:**
> **Hero:**
> Headline: "Less back-and-forth. More therapy."
> Subheadline: "Give your clients a booking link. They pick a time. It's confirmed. No emails, no phone tags, no missed appointments."
> CTA Button: "Get your booking link free" (not "Sign up" — too generic)
> Visual: Short screen recording showing a client booking a session in under 30 seconds

## The Expert Judgment Embedded

This skill applies the **PAS Framework** (Problem → Agitation → Solution) combined with **Conversion Copywriting** principles from Joanna Wiebe (Copyhackers). The single biggest landing page mistake is leading with the product and its features. Users don't care about your product — they care about their problem. A great landing page spends more time on the problem than the solution, because resonance with the problem is what makes the solution feel necessary.

The second biggest mistake: a CTA that says "Sign up" or "Get started." These communicate effort. The CTA should communicate value ("Get your free booking link") or outcome ("Start saving 3 hours a week").

## The Process

### Step 1: Source Material

The agent reads (or asks you to describe):
- Your `positioning.md` (one-liner, tagline, elevator pitch, objections)
- Your `customer-profile.md` (the painful moment, the workaround, the fear)
- Your `mvp-brief.md` (the 3 core features, the success signal)

If any are missing, the agent collects the key info directly.

### Step 2: Section-by-Section Writing

The agent writes each section in order:

**Section 1 — Hero**
- Headline: Should state the transformation (before → after) or the unique value in 10 words or less. Never the product name.
- Subheadline: The 2-sentence explanation of how. Can be more descriptive than the headline.
- CTA: Value-framed button text (not "Sign up")
- Visual guidance: What should appear next to/behind the headline

**Section 2 — Problem (Agitation)**
- Name the frustrating situation in your customer's language — the words they'd use, not yours
- Make them feel seen. The goal: "This is exactly my problem."
- 2–3 short paragraphs or a bulleted list of specific pain points

**Section 3 — Solution (The Better World)**
- Not a feature list — a description of life after using the product
- 3 benefit blocks: each has a benefit headline (outcome) + 2-sentence description
- Benefit ≠ Feature: "Shareable booking link" is a feature. "Clients book themselves — no back-and-forth" is a benefit.

**Section 4 — Social Proof**
- 2–3 testimonial formats: short pull quote, detailed story quote, or results stat
- If you have no testimonials yet: write placeholder copy and note what to replace it with
- Logos of recognizable users or press mentions (if any)

**Section 5 — How It Works**
- 3-step process: simple enough that a skeptic believes it could actually be this easy
- Each step: icon/number + short headline + one sentence
- End with: time to value ("You're fully set up in under 5 minutes")

**Section 6 — Objection Handling**
- FAQ section: 4–6 questions that address the real objections from `positioning.md`
- Questions written in the user's voice ("What if my clients don't want to use another tool?")

**Section 7 — Pricing Teaser (optional)**
- If you have a free tier or trial: mention it prominently
- If you're paid-only: one line on pricing with link to pricing page

**Section 8 — Final CTA**
- Repeat the primary CTA with slightly different framing
- Add a risk-reduction line: "No credit card required." / "Cancel anytime." / "Setup in 5 minutes."

### Step 3: Output

`landing-page-copy.md` — all sections with copy + visual notes, ready to hand to your agent to implement as a Next.js page.

## Worked Example

**Founder:** Yoga instructor booking tool. Has positioning doc and customer profile.

**Output excerpt:**
> **Hero:**
> Headline: **"Your students book themselves. You just teach."**
> Subheadline: Share one link. Students pick their class and time. You get notified. No DMs, no "is Tuesday still open?", no double-bookings.
> CTA: **"Get your free booking link"**
> Visual: 15-second screen recording — instructor shares a link in WhatsApp; client taps it, picks a time, sees confirmation. No explanation needed.
>
> **Problem:**
> Running classes is the good part. Everything around it — confirming who's coming, chasing people who dropped out, remembering who paid — that's the part nobody warned you about.
> If you teach 8–10 classes a week, you're spending 3–5 hours on logistics. That's a full extra workday. Every week.
> The solution isn't hiring an assistant. It's removing the coordination entirely.
>
> **Benefit Block 1:**
> **"One link does all the work"**
> Share your booking page anywhere — Instagram bio, WhatsApp, email signature. Students see your schedule, pick a class, and they're confirmed. You don't touch it.
>
> **Objection FAQ:**
> Q: My students are older — will they actually use this?
> A: The booking page works like any website and requires no account or app download. Students just tap a time and enter their name. If they can book a restaurant on OpenTable, they can book your class.
