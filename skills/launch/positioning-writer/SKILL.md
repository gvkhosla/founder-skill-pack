# Positioning Writer

## Quick Start

Say: **"Write my positioning"** or **"Help me explain what I do"**

You'll answer 5 questions. Total time: 15 minutes.
Output: `positioning.md` — one-liner, tagline, elevator pitch, and objection messaging.

## What You'll Get

A `positioning.md` containing: a one-liner (what you do in 10 words), a tagline (memorable, emotional, 5–7 words), a 3-sentence elevator pitch, the category you're positioning in, and counter-messaging for the top 3 objections.

> **Example output excerpt:**
> **One-liner:** The booking tool built for solo therapists who hate admin.
> **Tagline:** "Less back-and-forth. More therapy."
> **Elevator pitch:** Therapists lose hours every week to booking coordination — emails back and forth, no-shows, forgotten confirmations. TherapyBook gives them a simple booking link their clients actually use. Setup takes 5 minutes; the time savings start the same day.

## The Expert Judgment Embedded

This skill applies **April Dunford's Positioning Framework** from *Obviously Awesome* — the most practical framework for startup positioning. Most founders describe their product by features ("we have X, Y, Z") or category ("we're like Calendly for therapists"). Neither is positioning. Positioning answers: why should this specific person choose this over every alternative, including doing nothing?

The critical insight: your positioning isn't just what you say — it's the lens through which users evaluate you. Get it wrong and every feature sounds mediocre. Get it right and even simple features sound valuable.

For detailed framework reference, see [frameworks.md](frameworks.md).

## The Process

### Step 1: Competitive Alternatives

The agent asks: "When people decide NOT to use your product, what do they do instead?"

This is not your competitor list. It's the actual alternatives your users reach for — often spreadsheets, manual processes, or a combination of free tools. Positioning works against alternatives, not against imagined competitors.

### Step 2: Unique Attributes

The agent asks: "What does your product do that the alternatives absolutely cannot?"

Must be real and specific. "It's easier" is not positioning — "it requires zero setup" or "it sends booking confirmations automatically without any configuration" is.

### Step 3: Value for a Specific Customer

The agent combines your unique attributes with your customer profile: what does this uniquely mean for *this specific person*, in *their specific situation*?

This step produces the positioning insight — the "aha" that makes the one-liner possible.

### Step 4: Category Decision

The agent recommends which market category to position in:

| Category Type | When to Use | Risk |
|--------------|------------|------|
| **Existing category** ("booking software for therapists") | Category is well-understood, you compete on features | Must differentiate clearly |
| **Sub-category** ("no-setup booking for solo therapists") | You serve a niche better than general tools | Category must exist in buyer's mind |
| **New category** ("client communication OS") | You're creating a new way of thinking | Expensive to educate the market — avoid early stage |

For first products: **sub-category positioning** is almost always right.

### Step 5: Objection Counter-Messaging

The agent identifies the top 3 objections your target customer will have and writes a counter-message for each:
- "I already use Calendly" → [specific differentiator for your niche]
- "This seems too simple" → [why simple is the point]
- "I don't know if my clients will use it" → [social proof + ease framing]

### Step 6: Output

`positioning.md` — one-liner, tagline, elevator pitch, category, and objection counter-messages.

## Worked Example

**Founder:** Built a booking tool for independent yoga and fitness instructors.

**Output:**
> **Positioning — FitBook**
>
> **Competitive alternatives:** Google Calendar + DMs, Mindbody (complex, expensive), generic Calendly.
>
> **Unique attributes:** No monthly software subscription (flat pricing), designed specifically for solo instructors (no team/studio features to navigate), takes 3 minutes to set up vs. hours for Mindbody.
>
> **One-liner:** The booking tool solo fitness instructors set up in 3 minutes — and never think about again.
>
> **Tagline:** "Your classes, fully booked."
>
> **Elevator pitch:** Fitness instructors spend more time managing bookings than teaching. Mindbody is built for studios with staff — it's overkill for someone teaching 10 classes a week alone. FitBook is the alternative: set up a booking page in 3 minutes, share one link, and let clients book themselves. No features you don't need. No monthly subscription eating into your revenue.
>
> **Category:** Booking software for solo fitness instructors (sub-category of scheduling software)
>
> **Objection counter-messaging:**
> "I already use Calendly" → Calendly isn't built for class-based bookings with capacity limits. FitBook handles "8 spots per class" automatically; Calendly doesn't.
> "Mindbody works fine for me" → If setup time, monthly cost ($129+), and features you'll never use aren't bothering you, keep using it. FitBook is for instructors who want something simpler.
> "My clients are older and won't use an online booking link" → 73% of FitBook bookings are made by users over 50. The booking page is designed to be as simple as possible.

- Use **customer-hypothesis** before this — positioning flows from a sharp customer profile
- Use **landing-page-copywriter** after this — the positioning doc is the input to your landing page
- Use **pricing-model-framer** in parallel — pricing and positioning are two sides of the same decision
