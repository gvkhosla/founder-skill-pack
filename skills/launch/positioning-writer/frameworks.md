# Positioning Frameworks Reference

## April Dunford's Positioning Framework

From *Obviously Awesome: How to Nail Product Positioning So Customers Get It, Buy It, Love It.*

The five components of positioning:

### 1. Competitive Alternatives
What would customers do if your product didn't exist?
- This is NOT your competitor list (companies you think compete with you)
- It's the actual alternatives buyers use: spreadsheets, manual processes, free tools, doing nothing
- Your positioning works *against* these alternatives — not against your imagined competition

### 2. Unique Attributes
What do you have or do that alternatives don't?
- Must be genuinely unique — not just "we're better at X" but "we're the only ones who X"
- Features, data, team expertise, integrations, speed, distribution, community
- List every real differentiator — even small ones. They add up.

### 3. Value for Target Customers
What does each unique attribute mean for the specific buyer?
- Attribute: "Setup takes 3 minutes"
- Value: "You can start taking bookings today — no IT involvement, no week-long implementation"
- Connect every attribute to a specific outcome for the specific user

### 4. Target Customer Segmentation
Who cares most intensely about your value?
- Not "everyone with this problem" — the segment who feels the pain most acutely
- Early adopters: high pain, actively seeking solution, willing to take a risk on a new product
- Position for them first; broaden later

### 5. Market Category
What context do you want buyers to use to evaluate you?
- The frame determines what you're compared to and what "winning" means
- Choose poorly and you're judged against the wrong alternatives
- Options: existing category (compete directly), sub-category (niche down), new category (educate the market)

## The One-Liner Formula

**[Product name] is the [category] that [unique value] for [target customer].**

Examples:
- "Loom is the async video tool that replaces status update meetings for distributed teams."
- "Linear is the issue tracker built for high-performing engineering teams who find Jira exhausting."
- "FitBook is the booking software that solo fitness instructors set up in 3 minutes and never think about again."

The one-liner is not a tagline — it's your internal compass. The tagline is the emotional, memorable surface expression of the one-liner.

## Tagline Patterns

| Pattern | Example | Works For |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Outcome-focused** | "More therapy, less admin" | Productivity, efficiency products |
| **Before/After contrast** | "Proposals that win" | B2B tools with clear ROI |
| **Identity-based** | "Built for how you actually work" | Products targeting a specific persona |
| **Challenger** | "Jira was built for a different era" | Positioning against a known incumbent |
| **Simple declaration** | "Your classes, fully booked." | Simple consumer/SMB products |

## The Elevator Pitch Formula (3 sentences)

1. **The problem sentence:** Name the frustration or pain your target customer feels right now.
2. **The solution sentence:** What your product does (category + differentiator + for whom).
3. **The credibility/proof sentence:** Why they should believe it (speed, ease, proof point, or social proof).

Example:
1. "Fitness instructors spend more time managing bookings than teaching classes."
2. "FitBook is a booking page that solo instructors set up in 3 minutes — no features they don't need, no monthly subscription eating into their revenue."
3. "500 instructors use it today. Average setup time: 4 minutes. Average time saved per week: 3 hours."

## Objection Framework

Every product faces the same three categories of objection:

| Category | Example | Counter Strategy |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Alternative objection** | "I already use X" | Name the specific thing X can't do for this customer |
| **Relevance objection** | "That's not my biggest problem" | Reveal the downstream consequence they're underweighting |
| **Risk objection** | "What if it doesn't work?" | Reduce the risk: free trial, money-back, social proof, setup guarantee |
