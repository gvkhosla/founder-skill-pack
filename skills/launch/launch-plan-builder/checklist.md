# Launch Readiness Checklist

Run this before using `launch-plan-builder`. If you can't check everything in each section, the launch-plan-builder will build your plan accounting for the gaps — but it's better to resolve them first.

---

## Product Readiness

- [ ] Core flow works end-to-end without manual intervention
- [ ] New user can sign up and reach the value moment without help
- [ ] At least 3 real users (not friends/family) have used it and given feedback
- [ ] You've watched at least 2 users try the product in real time (not over their shoulder — actually watched them)
- [ ] No critical bugs that break the core job-to-be-done
- [ ] Mobile works or you've made a conscious decision to exclude mobile users for now

---

## Positioning Readiness

- [ ] `positioning.md` exists (run `positioning-writer` if not)
- [ ] You can explain what the product does in one sentence
- [ ] You know who it's specifically for (not "everyone who...")
- [ ] You know what the user is doing today instead of using your product
- [ ] You've tested the one-liner on 3 people who match the target customer and they immediately got it

---

## Landing Page Readiness

- [ ] Landing page is live with a real URL
- [ ] The headline matches the positioning (run `landing-page-copywriter` if not)
- [ ] There is one clear call to action (not two, not three — one)
- [ ] Signup or waitlist capture is working (tested end-to-end)
- [ ] Analytics are tracking who visits and what they do (PostHog, Plausible, or equivalent)

---

## Pricing Readiness

- [ ] `pricing-model.md` exists (run `pricing-model-framer` if not)
- [ ] The price is on the landing page or one click away
- [ ] If paid: payment flow works and has been tested with a real card
- [ ] If freemium: free tier limits are defined and enforced
- [ ] You have a conviction for the price (you could defend it to a skeptical user)

---

## Channel Readiness

**Owned:**
- [ ] Email list or CRM set up (even if it has 10 people)
- [ ] Personal outreach list of 20–50 people who match the target customer
- [ ] If you have a blog/newsletter: launch post drafted

**Rented:**
- [ ] 2–3 communities where the target customer spends time have been identified
- [ ] You've been active in at least one of them before the launch (not cold-posting)
- [ ] If Product Hunt: account active, hunter identified, assets prepared

**Borrowed:**
- [ ] 3–5 newsletters, podcasts, or creators in your target market identified
- [ ] Outreach started at least 2 weeks before launch (borrowed channels have lead time)

---

## Capture Readiness

- [ ] Every signup immediately gets a welcome email (within 5 minutes)
- [ ] You have a way to identify which channel each signup came from (UTM parameters or ask directly)
- [ ] You have a plan for the first response to every new user (personal message? onboarding call?)
- [ ] Calendar is clear for the first 48 hours after launch (you need to be present)

---

## Mindset Readiness

- [ ] You have defined what "successful launch" looks like before you launch (specific number — not vibes)
- [ ] You know the difference between a slow launch and a failed launch (they feel the same; they aren't)
- [ ] You've decided: the launch is a data collection event, not a judgment on the product or you

---

## If You Have Gaps

**Gaps in Product Readiness:** Don't launch. Fix the product first.

**Gaps in Positioning or Landing Page:** Run the relevant skill. Launch 3–5 days later.

**Gaps in Channel Readiness:** Launch anyway. You can build channels during the launch. Missing channels reduce reach, not validity.

**Gaps in Capture Readiness:** Fix now. These are low-effort, high-regret if missed.

**Gaps in Mindset Readiness:** Talk to the founder-partner.
