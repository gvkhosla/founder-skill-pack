# Launch Plan Builder

## Quick Start

Say: **"Build my launch plan"** or **"Help me plan my launch"**

Describe your product, your current audience, and your timeline. Total time: 15 minutes.
Output: `launch-plan.md` — a phased plan with specific weekly actions and a launch-day checklist.

## What You'll Get

A `launch-plan.md` with: your launch approach (phased, not a single moment), week-by-week actions for each channel, a launch-day checklist, and a "what to watch in the first 72 hours" monitoring guide.

> **Example output excerpt:**
> **Week 1 (Pre-launch):** Post in 2 yoga instructor Facebook groups — not promoting, just sharing a question: "What's the most annoying part of managing class bookings?" Capture replies. These are your testimonial seeds and copy hooks.
> **Launch Day:** Post in those same groups: "I built a solution to [exact problem they named]. Free while in beta. Here's the link." Personal, not promotional.

## The Expert Judgment Embedded

This skill applies the **Owned-Rented-Borrowed (ORB) channel framework** combined with the insight that for first products, **community-native launches outperform broadcast launches by 10x**. Most founders launch by posting on Twitter and LinkedIn and getting 12 likes from friends. That's a broadcast launch. It doesn't work.

What works: going to exactly where your target customer already spends time, showing up as a person (not a product), building genuine pre-launch relationships, and making the first ask feel like a favor between people who know each other — not a cold pitch.

The phasing is critical: Internal → Alpha → Beta → Full. Most founders skip straight to Full launch and wonder why nobody shows up.

For the complete launch checklist, see [checklist.md](checklist.md).

## The Process

### Step 1: Audience Assessment

The agent asks three questions:
1. How many people currently know this product exists?
2. Do you have any existing audience (email list, social followers, community members)?
3. Where does your target customer spend time online?

Answers determine launch strategy. A founder with 0 audience needs a very different plan than one with 2,000 email subscribers.

### Step 2: Channel Selection (ORB)

The agent recommends 1–2 channels from each tier:

**Owned channels** (you control, compounds over time):
- Email list → Personal outreach to first 50 people who might be users
- Product waitlist → Pre-launch landing page with email capture

**Rented channels** (platforms you don't control):
- Reddit communities relevant to your user
- Facebook groups where your customer hangs out
- Twitter/X if your customer is active there
- LinkedIn for B2B products

**Borrowed channels** (tap into someone else's audience):
- Podcast appearances in your niche
- Guest posts on newsletters your customer reads
- DMs to 10 micro-influencers in your space
- Partnerships with complementary tools

### Step 3: Week-by-Week Plan

The agent creates a 4-week plan:

**Week 1 — Seed (Pre-launch)**
Focus: Find your first 10 potential users. Don't launch publicly yet.
- Identify 3 communities where your customer is active
- Join them and participate without promoting anything
- Post a question about the problem your product solves
- DM 10 people who respond with the highest pain signals
- Offer them free beta access

**Week 2 — Soft Launch (Alpha)**
Focus: Get your first 5–10 real users.
- Share directly with the 10 people from Week 1
- Ask them to use the product and give feedback in exchange for a free account
- Fix the top 3 issues they find
- Capture their words: "How would you describe this to a friend?"

**Week 3 — Beta Expansion**
Focus: Expand to 20–50 users. Start gathering social proof.
- Post in communities with personal framing ("I built this after struggling with X")
- Share 1–2 testimonials or results from your alpha users
- Launch on Product Hunt (beta label, not full launch)

**Week 4 — Full Launch**
Focus: Maximum visibility. Convert the awareness spike.
- Post across all channels simultaneously
- Email your waitlist
- Product Hunt full launch
- Pitch 3 newsletters in your niche for coverage
- "This is live" message to your personal network

### Step 4: Launch-Day Checklist

From [checklist.md](checklist.md) — a 20-item checklist for launch day itself, covering pre-launch, the moment of launch, and the first 4 hours.

### Step 5: 72-Hour Monitoring Guide

What to watch in the first 3 days:
- Where is traffic coming from? (PostHog / analytics)
- Where are people dropping off in the signup flow?
- What questions are people asking in DMs or comments?
- What's the conversion rate from visitor to signup?

### Step 6: Output

`launch-plan.md` — the full plan with weekly actions, channel strategy, and launch-day checklist embedded.

## Worked Example

**Founder:** Yoga instructor booking tool. 0 existing audience. Target customer: solo yoga instructors, especially active in Facebook groups and Instagram.

**Output (Week 1–2 excerpt):**
> **Week 1 — Seed**
> Monday: Join "Yoga Teachers Network" and "Yoga Business Collective" Facebook groups (both 10k+ members). Don't post yet — read for 3 days.
> Thursday: Post in both groups: "Question for solo instructors — what's the most painful part of managing bookings? For me it was the endless DMs. What about you?" Do NOT mention your product.
> Friday-Sunday: Reply to every comment personally. Identify the 10 people with the clearest pain signals. DM them: "Your comment really resonated — I've been building something that might help. Would you try it for free and tell me what you think?"
>
> **Week 2 — Alpha**
> Monday: Onboard the 5 people who said yes. Do a 15-minute call with each — watch them use the product, don't explain it.
> Wednesday: Fix the top issue every user hit (almost certainly the same issue).
> Friday: Ask each user: "How would you describe this to another yoga instructor?" Write down their exact words — this is your copy.

## Related Skills

- Use **positioning-writer** before this — your positioning doc shapes the launch messaging
- Use **landing-page-copywriter** before this — the landing page needs to be live before launch
- Use **pricing-model-framer** before this — pricing needs to be decided before the full launch
- Use **cycle-reflector** (Compound phase) after the first week of launch — captures what you learned from the launch itself
