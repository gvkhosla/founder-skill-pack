## Decision Rules

1. **Don't integrate what you haven't validated you need.** No analytics tool until you have users. No support tool until users are complaining. Add integrations in response to evidence, not in anticipation of problems.

2. **Supabase replaces 4 tools.** If you're not using Supabase, ask why before adding individual auth, database, storage, and realtime tools separately.

3. **Free tiers are real.** PostHog, Supabase, Vercel, Loops — all have real free tiers. Don't pay until you're generating revenue.

4. **Complexity has a cost.** Every integration you add is something to maintain, debug, and pay for. The minimum viable integration stack is usually 3–5 tools total.
