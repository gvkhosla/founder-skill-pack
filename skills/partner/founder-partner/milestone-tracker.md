# Milestone Tracker

The milestones that matter on the journey from idea to PMF and beyond.
The founder-partner records these in `founder-context.md` when they're crossed.

## The Journey Milestones

### Stage 1 — Validation

**First real user**
Not a friend, not a family member, not an investor. Someone with the actual problem who found or was introduced to the product in a context where saying no was genuinely possible.
*Why it matters:* Proof that at least one real person thinks this is worth trying.

**First feedback that stings**
A user tells you something true about the product that you didn't want to hear. Not "it's nice" or "interesting concept." Something specific about what doesn't work.
*Why it matters:* This is the first moment the product talks back. The founders who listen get better products.

### Stage 2 — Compounding

**First complete build cycle**
The first time you've shipped something, reflected on what happened, gathered real user signal, and committed to one specific improvement based on what you learned.
*Why it matters:* The cycle is the engine. Starting the engine is a milestone.

**MPP score first reaches 5.0**
The halfway point. Product is functional and some users find real value. Still not proud, but not embarrassed.
*Why it matters:* Marks the transition from "does it work?" to "does it matter?"

**MPP score reaches 7.0 — MPP Achieved**
The threshold of genuine pride. You'd show this to anyone without apologizing.
*Why it matters:* This is the goal of the compounding stage. Everything before this was preparation.

**First unprompted recommendation**
A user describes the product to someone else without being asked. The first proof that the product creates enough value to pass the "would I tell a friend?" test.
*Why it matters:* This is the leading indicator of word-of-mouth. The first one is a signal, not a coincidence.

### Stage 3 — PMF

**PMF signal: Faint**
Retention curve hasn't gone to zero. 1–2 unprompted shares documented. At least one user can articulate specifically what they'd lose.
*Why it matters:* The signal is present. It's early, but it's real.

**PMF signal: Building**
A core cohort retains consistently (D30 > 20%). Word of mouth is happening without incentive. Users can articulate specific value.
*Why it matters:* The pull is starting. This is the point to understand what's driving it and amplify it.

**First paying customer**
The first person who gave you real money — not a pilot, not a "maybe," not a discount deal with a friend. A genuine commercial transaction.
*Why it matters:* Revenue is a forcing function for clarity. If someone paid, something is real.

**North star metric first improves cycle-over-cycle**
Two consecutive cycles where the north star goes up. Not a spike — a trend.
*Why it matters:* Signals that the compounding work is translating into genuine product-market progress.

**PMF signal: Clear**
Retention curve has flattened (some cohort stabilizes). Net revenue retention > 100%. Users proactively share. Would-be churned users request to stay.
*Why it matters:* This is it. The market is pulling. The hard work of compounding has paid off.

### Stage 4 — Scale

**First $1,000 MRR**
The business can sustain itself at a small level.

**First $10,000 MRR**
The business is real. This is often the point where the founder stops wondering if it's going to work.

**Growth loop working**
The loop metric is positive and improving. Growth is compounding, not requiring proportional marketing effort.

**First hire**
The founder can't do everything alone anymore.

## How the Partner Uses This

The partner checks milestone status at the start of every session. When one is crossed:

1. Names it explicitly: "I want to mark something before we continue. [Milestone] just happened."
2. Takes a moment — doesn't rush past it
3. Records it in `founder-context.md` with the date
4. Asks: "What does this mean for what you're working on next?"

Milestones that go unacknowledged become things founders forget happened. The partner makes sure the journey is remembered as it's being lived — not just in retrospect.
